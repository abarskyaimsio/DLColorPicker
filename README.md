# DLColorPicker

**DLColorPicker** is a loose collection of **UIControls**â€¦
* `DLCPHexPicker`* `DLCPHuePicker`* `DLCPBrightnessPicker`* `DLCPAlphaPicker`* `DLCPSaturationBrightnessPicker`* `DLCPHueSaturationPicker`
**DLColorPicker** uses **no image files**, but instead renders them **efficiently** via `CAGradientLayer`s.

As each one of the pickers isn't that usefull on its own, **DLColorPicker** also includes a pair of **UIViewControllers**:
* `DLCPGradientColorPickerController` (as seen on the left in the preview)* `DLCPWaterfallColorPickerController` (as seen on the right in the preview)

Don't want a hex picker? No problem: Just don't add it to your view then. ;) Same for alpha, etc.
